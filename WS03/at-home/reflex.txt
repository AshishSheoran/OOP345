â€”	What was learned during the workshop:

	During the workshop, I learned how to create templated classes, functions, specialized template classes and functions, defining template constructors and functions outside of the class that it's in.
	How to use one class template within another class template.

1.)  The reason for specializing the sum() member function.

	The specialization of sum() was necessary because the original sum:

	V sum(const L& lbl, const V& val) const {
            if(key() == lbl) {
                return val + value();
            }
            return val;
        }

	Only assumes that the type of sum that was being passed is a number which can be added with a '+' natively. Specializing sum() such as:

	 template<>
   	 std::string SummableLVPair<std::string, std::string>::sum(const std::string& label, const std::string& val) const {
        	if(key() == label) {
         	   if(val == "") {
         	       return value();
         	   }
         	   return val + "," + value();
        	}
        	return val;
  	}

	ensures that strings are properly 'concatenated' rather than attempted to be added natively.

2.). The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.

	This again relates to the reason why we specialized some of the methods in the classes. The 2nd template argument could either be an integer or a string. 
	By specializing initialValue, we can control what the safe empty value is for its initial value as shown in the following:

	// Explicit specialization of LVList<std::string, std::string>
	template<>
    	std::string SummableLVPair<std::string, std::string>::initialValue = "";

	// Explicit specialization of LVList<std::string, int>
	template<>
    	int SummableLVPair<std::string, int>::initialValue = 0;
